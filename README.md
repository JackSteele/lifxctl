# lifxctl

## The Concept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sitting alone at your desk at `04:00` on Friday of finals week? Does the concept of yet another `\begin{align*}` fill you with overwhelming existential dread? Are you questioning every single decision that led you to this point?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you answered yes to two or more of those questions, you must want nothing more than to turn out the lights and welcome the warm embrace of the void. But there's a problem. Your phone, upside down and across the room, is both literally and figuratively out of your reach. An exercise left to the reader proves that you must rot in the scalding light rather than leave your chair - but wait... LIFX must have some sort of API, right?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than anything, what you *really* want is a distraction. A sweet, sweet distraction. You've invented a problem for yourself, and the time has come to solve it.

## The Program
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This thing is pretty barebones at the moment. Open up `token.txt` and toss your token in there. Run `lifxctl.py` with `-h` and you'll figure out what to do next. Oh, but you'll need to get your API token before you do any of this. Once again, this exercise is best left to the reader.

## The Future
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been wanting this to exist for so long - once finals are over it will be revisited.
